        <h2>SSRL</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p>As of 2019, I was accepted into the UGA Small Satellite Research Laboratory (<a href="http://smallsat.uga.edu/" style="color: #333; text-decoration: underline;">SSRL</a>) as a
          member of the MOCI Electronics Team. Now the MOCI Flight Software Team.</p>
        <p>Currently I am working on the MOCI (Multiview Onboard Computational Imager) satellite.
          More specifically I was tasked to develop the API for the Nvidia TX2i that will be
          launched on the satellite as part of its payload. I have developed this control program in Python
          and it successfuly commands the optical payload by taking pictures as well as transferring its own
          telemetry and the gathered images to the Onboard Computer (OBC) through UART. <br>
          The TX2i's main goal is to gather images and perform Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate
          3D models of its targets, like Mount Everest. To do this the TX2 has different states or
          functions and the master program handles these programs. I was also
          tasked with developing a program to handle the switching back and forth between the
          several data processing states that the TX2i will need to have.</p><br>
          <p>
            Most recently, in August of 2020, I was promoted to the MOCI Flight Software Team Lead.
            During this time the team grew to be the largest team at the SSRL and we have succesfully
            sped up the development of MOCI's Flight Software.<br>
            I moved on to develop the interface between our OBC and the Attitude and Determination Control System (ADCS)
            which will control the positon and orientation of the satellite in orbit. This component is one of largest
            components onboard MOCI and requires the use of I2C.

        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<p>With my induction into the SSRL at UGA, my professional focus has been set on the
	  aerospace industry. I plan, that when I graduate in May 2022, to work for the aerospace industry
	  and help develop subsystems and control programs for satellites and other spacecraft as an Embedded Software Engineer
    or a Flight Software Engineer.</p><br>
    <p>
      The SSRL has allowed me to learn so much about developing robust and solid software and develop my skills as a software
      developer. I have learned so much about software but also about how sofware interacts with hardware. We use Arduinos and 
      RaspberryPis almost daily to help us test our code before we integrate with a component. All of these skills have prepared
      me for the aerospace industy and I am ready to tackle any challenge thats ahead of me.
